 ## Why I Found It Interesting
What I like is the clarity: instead of randomly picking problems, I can follow a sequence that builds up key patterns step by step. It saves time and makes prep more manageable. The focus on problem types rather than memorizing specific solutions also makes it easier to apply what I learn in real interviews.
